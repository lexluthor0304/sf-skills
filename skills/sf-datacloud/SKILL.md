# sf-datacloud: Salesforce Data Cloud Orchestrator

Use this skill when the user needs **product-level Data Cloud workflow guidance** rather than a single isolated command family: pipeline setup, cross-phase troubleshooting, data spaces, data kits, or deciding whether a task belongs in Connect, Prepare, Harmonize, Segment, Act, or Retrieve.

This skill intentionally follows sf-skills house style while using the external `sf data360` command surface as the runtime. The plugin is **not vendored into this repo**.

---

## When This Skill Owns the Task

Use `sf-datacloud` when the work involves:
- multi-phase Data Cloud setup or remediation
- data spaces (`sf data360 data-space *`)
- data kits (`sf data360 data-kit *`)
- health checks (`sf data360 doctor`)
- CRM-to-unified-profile pipeline design
- deciding how to move from ingestion → harmonization → segmentation → activation
- cross-phase troubleshooting where the root cause is not yet clear

Delegate to a phase-specific skill when the user is focused on one area:

| Phase | Use this skill | Typical scope |
|---|---|---|
| Connect | [sf-datacloud-connect](../sf-datacloud-connect/SKILL.md) | connections, connectors, source discovery |
| Prepare | [sf-datacloud-prepare](../sf-datacloud-prepare/SKILL.md) | data streams, DLOs, transforms, DocAI |
| Harmonize | [sf-datacloud-harmonize](../sf-datacloud-harmonize/SKILL.md) | DMOs, mappings, identity resolution, data graphs |
| Segment | [sf-datacloud-segment](../sf-datacloud-segment/SKILL.md) | segments, calculated insights |
| Act | [sf-datacloud-act](../sf-datacloud-act/SKILL.md) | activations, activation targets, data actions |
| Retrieve | [sf-datacloud-retrieve](../sf-datacloud-retrieve/SKILL.md) | SQL, search indexes, vector search, async query |

Delegate outside the family when the user is:
- extracting Session Tracing / STDM telemetry → [sf-ai-agentforce-observability](../sf-ai-agentforce-observability/SKILL.md)
- writing CRM SOQL only → [sf-soql](../sf-soql/SKILL.md)
- loading CRM source data → [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md)
- creating missing CRM schema → [sf-metadata](../sf-metadata/SKILL.md)
- implementing downstream Apex or Flow logic → [sf-apex](../sf-apex/SKILL.md), [sf-flow](../sf-flow/SKILL.md)

---

## Required Context to Gather First

Ask for or infer:
- target org alias
- whether the plugin is already installed and linked
- whether the user wants design guidance, read-only inspection, or live mutation
- data sources involved: CRM objects, external databases, file ingestion, knowledge, etc.
- desired outcome: unified profiles, segments, activations, vector search, analytics, or troubleshooting
- whether the user is working in the default data space or a custom one

If plugin availability is uncertain, start with:
- [references/plugin-setup.md](references/plugin-setup.md)
- `scripts/verify-plugin.sh`
- `scripts/bootstrap-plugin.sh`

---

## Core Operating Rules

- Use the external `sf data360` plugin runtime; do **not** reimplement or vendor the command layer.
- Prefer the smallest phase-specific skill once the task is localized.
- For `sf data360` commands, suppress linked-plugin warning noise with `2>/dev/null` unless the stderr output is needed for debugging.
- Distinguish **Data Cloud SQL** from CRM SOQL.
- Preserve Data Cloud-specific API-version workarounds when they matter.
- Prefer generic, reusable JSON definition files over org-specific workshop payloads.

---

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Verify the runtime
Confirm:
- `sf` is installed
- the community Data Cloud plugin is linked
- the target org is authenticated

Recommended checks:
```bash
sf data360 man
sf org display -o <alias>
bash ~/.claude/skills/sf-datacloud/scripts/verify-plugin.sh <alias>
```

### 2. Discover existing state before changing anything
Use read-only inspection first:
```bash
sf data360 doctor -o <org> 2>/dev/null
sf data360 data-stream list -o <org> 2>/dev/null
sf data360 dmo list --all -o <org> 2>/dev/null
sf data360 identity-resolution list -o <org> 2>/dev/null
sf data360 segment list -o <org> 2>/dev/null
```

### 3. Localize the phase
Route the task:
- source/connector issue → Connect
- ingestion/DLO/stream issue → Prepare
- mapping/IR/unified profile issue → Harmonize
- audience or insight issue → Segment
- downstream push issue → Act
- SQL/search/index issue → Retrieve

### 4. Choose deterministic artifacts when possible
Prefer JSON definition files and repeatable scripts over one-off manual steps. Generic templates live in:
- `assets/definitions/data-stream.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/dmo.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/mapping.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/relationship.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/identity-resolution.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/data-graph.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/calculated-insight.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/segment.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/activation-target.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/activation.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/data-action-target.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/data-action.template.json`
- `assets/definitions/search-index.template.json`

### 5. Verify after each phase
Typical verification:
- stream/DLO exists
- DMO/mapping exists
- identity resolution run completed
- unified records or segment counts look correct
- activation/search index status is healthy

---

## High-Signal Gotchas

- `connection list` requires `--connector-type`.
- `dmo list` should usually use `--all`.
- Segment creation may need `--api-version 64.0`.
- `segment members` returns opaque IDs; use SQL joins for human-readable details.
- Many long-running jobs are asynchronous in practice even when the command returns quickly.
- Some Data Cloud operations still require UI setup outside the CLI runtime.

## Output Format

When finishing, report in this order:
1. **Task classification**
2. **Runtime status**
3. **Phase(s) involved**
4. **Commands or artifacts used**
5. **Verification result**
6. **Next recommended step**

Suggested shape:

```text
Data Cloud task: <setup / inspect / troubleshoot / migrate>
Runtime: <plugin ready / missing / partially verified>
Phases: <connect / prepare / harmonize / segment / act / retrieve>
Artifacts: <json files, commands, scripts>
Verification: <passed / partial / blocked>
Next step: <next phase or cross-skill handoff>
```

## Cross-Skill Integration

| Need | Delegate to | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| load or clean CRM source data | [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md) | seed or fix source records before ingestion |
| create missing CRM schema | [sf-metadata](../sf-metadata/SKILL.md) | Data Cloud expects existing objects/fields |
| deploy permissions or bundles | [sf-deploy](../sf-deploy/SKILL.md) | environment preparation |
| write Apex against Data Cloud outputs | [sf-apex](../sf-apex/SKILL.md) | code implementation |
| Flow automation after segmentation/activation | [sf-flow](../sf-flow/SKILL.md) | declarative orchestration |
| session tracing / STDM / parquet analysis | [sf-ai-agentforce-observability](../sf-ai-agentforce-observability/SKILL.md) | different Data Cloud use case |
